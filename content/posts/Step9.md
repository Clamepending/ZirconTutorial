## Insert teensy

Be careful with this step. Make sure not to bend any pins and make sure all pins are going into the slots they are supposed to.

THE DIRECTION DOES MATTER, so make sure you put it in the correct way.

## Double Check

Double check if the teensy is put in the right way.

## Battery Check

Get your battery case.

Insert the AA batteries into the battery holder.

## Magic smoke

Check if your battery case is soldered correctly (make sure you did not mix up the red and black wires!). 

Plug it into the Zircon through the T connector. If the line sensors and teensy have not turned on (shown by an led), flip the big switch.

The line snesors should light up.

Take the compass sensor and connect it to the Zircon through its 4 pin cable. The compass should light up with a green LED. If the LEDs do not light up, unplug the battery and check if it is hot. Make sure you plugged in everything in the correct slot, line sensors are in the exact orientation they should be, and the 4 pin JST port is in the correct direction.
