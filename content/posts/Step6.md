## Double layered wheel

Take 3 bolts and 3 nuts (the smaller ones called m2) and secure the two wheels together.

## secure wheel onto motor

Slide the omniwheel onto the shaft of a motor from Part 4.

Make sure the pin of the motor slides into the slot on the omniwheel.

If you have trouble here, it is probably because you mixed up the order of the black center pieces or put the omni wheel onto the shaft backwards.

Secure the omniwheel onto the motor by screwing an aluminum standoff onto the motor shaft.

You dont have to put the motor on the mainboard yet!

## Repeat!

The result should look like this.
repeat 3 times for each other motor

You dont have to put the motor on the mainboard yet!
