## Materials used

1. 15:1 gear motor set x3
2. Wire x6

## Tools needed

1. Solder
2. Soldering iron
3. Phillips head screw driver
4. Pliers

First, open the gear motor set.

Put the two black motor casing parts around the motor until it is snug. You may have to rotate the motor around so that the rectangular indent lines up with the black casing.

Use a screwdriver to secure the casing to the motor with two screws

## Shaft pin

Be especially careful with this step Use pliers to put the metal pin into the hole in the shaft of the motor.

This step requires some force, but make sure not to bend or break the pin. The shaft should look like this:

## Soldering motor wires

Solder a wire to each of the motor tabs. Make sure to not be too slow at soldering and melt the plastic of the motor.

Repeat for the other 2 motors.

The result should look like this
