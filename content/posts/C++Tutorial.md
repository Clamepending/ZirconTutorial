## How will this work?

Each topic will have a video, problem, and solution

Watch the video, then try to solve the problem on your own before looking at the answer

each problem builds on the previous, so not understanding one will make the next harder

There are MULTIPLE ways to solve the problem. Dont worry if your solution doesnt look exactly like the answer!

## Stuck? GOOGLE IT!

It is normal to not get it on the first try, keep at it!

ask others for help and help others!
