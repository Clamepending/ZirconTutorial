## What is Soldering?


Soldering is used to make an electrical connection between two parts. It involves melting the solder with the soldering iron (at 250° - 350°C) and touching the molten solder onto where the connection is needed.

If you want extra practice before getting started on the kit, you can use something like https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14635.

## Soldering practice

To practice soldering, put some solder on the two big square pads on the Zircon as shown below.

Tip: Don't hold the soldering iron to any part for a long period of time, because that could damage the part. If you find yourself heating up a region for more than 30 seconds, you should let the board cool for 20 seconds before you try again.

## Battery port

We will now install the battery port.

Find the red T-connector

(image)

Put it in the slot on the main board. Make sure your board is right side up as in the picture.

(image before)

(image after)

Turn the board over and solder the connector to the board.

Afterwards your board should look like this.
