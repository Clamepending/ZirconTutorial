## Lets make the battery!

First find the battery case:

(battery case img)

Find the female T-Connector. 

(female t connector img)

Find the male T-Connector. 

(male t connector img)

Now we need to connect the two. To do that we will use soldering.


## What is Soldering?

(video of what soldering is and how to solder https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqvHogekDI4&t=120s)

Soldering is used to make an electrical connection between two parts. It involves melting the solder with the soldering iron and touching the molten solder onto where the connection is needed.

If you want extra practice before getting started on the kit, you can use something like https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14635.


## Soldering practice

Plug your connectors together as follows:

Hold your battery case and connector in place with tape as follows (you can hold the parts with your hand but someparts will get very hot so be careful!).

Make sure you are soldering the female connector!

VIDEO:
Then plug in your iron to heat it. After 2 minutes it should be hot, test by melting solder.

place soldering iron on part to heat the connector for 1 second.

Then touch solder to the pad.

If you mess up or take longer than 10 seconds, let the parts cool for 20 seconds before trying again

## Battery port

We will now install the battery port.

Find the red T-connector

(image)

Put it in the slot on the main board. Make sure your board is right side up as in the picture.

(image before)

(image after)

Turn the board over and solder the connector to the board.

Afterwards your board should look like this.
