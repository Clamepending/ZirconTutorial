![Finished Teensy](/img/steps/teensycroped.jpg)

# Materials used:

1. Teensy LC x1
2. Male header pins x2

# Tools needed:

1. Solder
2. Soldering iron

# Header Pins

It is important to solder the header pins straight, and not have them slanted

To break header pins into the right length, use your fingernails or a wire cutter on the indent between the pins where you want to make a cut.

With fingernail: Apply pressure as close you can to the fingernail to bend the header pin to minimise the chance of the header pin breaking at some other point.

With wire cutter: align the mouth of the wire cutter with the indent where you want to cut the header pin and squeeze.

### Please cut the following length header pins:

1. 14 pin long header pin x2
2. 3 pin long header pin x1
3. 1 pin long header pin x1

Take a 14 pin header pin and put it in one side of the teensy, making sure all 14 pins go into a hole

### Solder ONLY ONE pin first.

Inspect the header pin to see if it is slanted or has a gap like the one below. To fix any issues, (like a slanted header pin in the picture), melt the soldered pin and adjust the header pin, then remove the soldering iron to let the solder harden again. Make sure not to heat up the header pin too long or else it will start to melt. It is ok to take multiple tries and let the header pin cool down between attempts.

The top side should look like this

Repeat the process on the other side with 14 more pins

Take the 3 pin header and put it into the inside 3 pins of the teensy. Solder 1 pin and make sure the header pin is straight without any gaps. Correct as needed like above, and solder the rest of the pins once done.

The result should look like this:
